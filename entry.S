# Using GRUB 2, you can boot xv6 from a file stored in a
# Linux file system by copying kernel or kernelmemfs to /boot
# and then adding this menu entry:
#
# menuentry "xv6" {
# 	insmod ext2
# 	set root='(hd0,msdos1)'
# 	set kernel='/boot/kernel'
# 	echo "Loading ${kernel}..."
# 	multiboot ${kernel} ${kernel}
# 	boot
# }

# Multiboot header.  Data to direct multiboot loader.
# The Multiboot header must be contained completely within the first 8192 bytes of the OS image, and must be longword (32-bit) aligned. In general, it should come as early as possible, and may be embedded in the beginning of the text segment after the real executable header.

## Paging is controlled by the PG flag in control register CR0. When this flag is clear (its state following a hardware reset), the paging mechanism is turned off; when it is set, paging is enabled. Before setting the PG flag, the following data structures and registers must be initialized:
## > Software must load at least one page directory and one page table into physical memory. The page table can be eliminated if the page directory contains a directory entry pointing to itself (here, the page directory and page table reside in the same page), or if only 4-MByte pages are used.(4M byte pages!!)
## > Control register CR3 (also called the PDBR register) is loaded with the physical base address of the page directory.
## > (Optional) Software may provide one set of code and data descriptors in the GDT or in an LDT for supervisor mode and another set for user mode.
